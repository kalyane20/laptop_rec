# 💻 Flipkart Laptop Recommendation Chatbot

This project is an intelligent chatbot built to recommend laptops based on user preferences using the Flipkart laptops dataset. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LangChain agents**, and **Groq API** to deliver fast and accurate recommendations. The application is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface and **ChromaDB** for vector-based search.
